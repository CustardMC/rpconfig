# RPConfig
This is a Fabric/Quilt and NeoForge mod for configuring resourcepacks.

# How is this useful
You can use this mod to change some aspects of compatible resource packs, allowing for users to enable and disable features they may not need or want, as well as allow resource pack creators to have much more textures in their packs but have some be disabled by default if they think not everyone would want it.

We're using the Unlicense License so you're free to do any modifications on it and be able to distribute it. We only ***ask*** you to credit us and keep compatibility with the base mod.
